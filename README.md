`batchdav` is a Rust program for traversing a WebDAV file hierarchy using a
user-specified number of concurrent worker tasks and timing how long the
traversal takes.  It was written as part of investigating dandi/dandidav#54
(primarily to double-check that the results seen there weren't due to some
quirk of rsync).

The traversal handles non-collection resources by simply making `HEAD` requests
to them without following any redirects; if the server responds with a
redirect, the original and target URL will both be printed if running `batchdav
run` without the `--quiet` option.


Usage
=====

    batchdav <command> [<args>]

`batchdav` has two subcommands: `run`, for performing a single traversal; and
`batch`, for performing multiple traversals with different numbers of workers
and summarizing the results.

Worker tasks are executed on a multithreaded asynchronous executor.  By
default, the executor uses as many threads as your machine has CPUs; a
different amount can be specified via the `TOKIO_WORKER_THREADS` environment
variable.

`run`
-----

    batchdav run [-q|--quiet] <url> <workers>

Traverse the WebDAV hierarchy at the given URL using the given number of
concurrent workers.  The elapsed time and number of requests made is printed at
the end.

If the `-q`/`--quiet` option is not given, then as each request is completed,
the URL requested is printed out along with the type of resource at that URL
(`DIR` or `FILE`) and, for non-collection resources, the URL (if any) that the
resource's URL redirects to.

`batch`
-------

    batchdav batch [-s|--samples <int>] <url> <workers> ...

Traverse the WebDAV hierarchy at the given URL repeatedly and summarize the
elapsed times.  For each number of workers listed on the command line, a
traversal is performed a number of times given by the `--samples` option
(default: 10).  Upon completion, a CSV document listing the mean & standard
deviation of the times for each number of workers is output.
